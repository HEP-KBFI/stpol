git hash: 39a2ddb
Explanation:
Changed the MVA training fundamentally. Now we're using inclusive samples for training and exclusive samples for testing/plotting. In addition, this is the first MVA training where we do multiple MVAs in accordance to variable ranking allowing us to choose also partial variable list if we want to. What has also changed is the BDT variable naming in the trees:
* Electrons, the best is: mva_BDT_with_top_mass_C_eta_lj_el_pt_mt_el_pt_bj_mass_bj_met_mass_lj
* Muons, the best is: mva_BDT_with_top_mass_eta_lj_C_mu_pt_mt_mu_met_mass_bj_pt_bj_mass_lj
If one wants one can remove part of the names ending to get an MVA with smaller list of vars. For example an MVA with only top three vars would be:
* Electrons: mva_BDT_with_top_mass_C_eta_lj
* Muons: mva_BDT_with_top_mass_eta_lj_C
