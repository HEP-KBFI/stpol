Analysis plotting code
======================
Different types of scripts are divided into subdirectories.
Among them `plotfw` is the plotting library module.
Couple general scripts can also be found in the root directory.

Note that the `newplots` directory has to be in the `$PYTHONPATH`
environment variable for the scripts to work.
Running `setenv.sh` will add it automatically.
